<h3> Heard of Boston Dynamics?</h3>

Well, we at MaRS are currently working on<b><i> "Chitrak"</i></b>, probably India's first fully actuated Quadruped Robot.
<br><br>
We started with a mini prototype in last Srishti and today we have a better prototype learning to walk, talking it's baby steps.
Chitrak has a long way to go and we are working hard to make it as advanced as and beyond Cheetah, SpotMini or BigDog
